This project focuses on enhancing web security through artificial intelligence by analyzing three major web elements: URLs, cookies, and online advertisements. Using web scraping tools like Selenium and Beautiful Soup, data was collected and processed with NumPy and Pandas for feature extraction and analysis. The project applied Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithms to classify web elements as safe or malicious, achieving up to 98% training accuracy and 97% testing accuracy.

A user-friendly Flask-based web interface was developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling users to input URLs, cookies, or ads for real-time vulnerability detection. While the model faced challenges such as limited datasets, overfitting, and the dynamic nature of web elements, proposed solutions included expanding data collection using high-performance computing and incorporating retraining pipelines.

This project demonstrates a scalable, AI-driven approach to combat evolving cyber threats, providing a reliable platform for detecting and mitigating malicious web activities.
